# AI Energy Optimization Project

This project focuses on developing AI agents to optimize energy production and supply using machine learning techniques.

## Project Objectives

- Forecast energy demand using historical consumption data.
- Predict renewable energy production based on weather data.
- Optimize energy storage and release to align supply with demand.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Install Dependencies:**

   - Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
   - Install required libraries:

     ```bash
